# CS 98: Hex-background-changer

This application makes a random hex value, from an array of all possible hex values, and changes the applications background. The solution utilizes a javascript function that concatenates 6 different randomized hex values to a string that begins with the '#' character - meaning that the background color can be swapped with a simple call.

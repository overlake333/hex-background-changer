# CS 98: Hex-background-changer

This application is a simple webpage where a user clicks on a button, and the application creates a random hex value from an array of all possible hex values. This then changes the application's background in addition to showing the hex value itself. The solution utilizes a javascript function that concatenates 6 different randomized hex values to a string that begins with the '#' character - meaning that the background color can be swapped with a simple call. 

## Viewing and Testing Website

2. Hover over the "click me" button to see the button change color
3. Click on the "click me" button to see a randomized hex value appear
4. To further test, right hand click the "click me" button and click on "Inspect" to further test the application.
